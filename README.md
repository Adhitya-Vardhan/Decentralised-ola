# Decentralised-Ola

This is a Decentralised Ride hailing system, this removes the intermediary of a 3rd party company between the Riders and Drivers who wish to connect. Generally these 3rd party companies would charge extra for the service of connecting drivers and Riders. And some times thier is no Componsation if the ride gets cancelled in the middle. Their is scope for human error too.

Which the help of Block chain technology we can make this process decentralised
which leads to open and fairer system.
